# JPG-Title-Snapper
JPGTitleSnapper is a script for Adobe InDesign that automates JPEG export by naming files based on a specific text box's content on each page. This ensures logical organization of files, reflecting the document's content, and reduces manual errors.


System Requirements

Operating System: Compatible with both Windows and macOS.
Installation
Download the Script:

Save the JPGTitleSnapper.jsx file to your local machine.
Install the Script:

Navigate to your InDesign scripts folder:
Windows: C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\InDesign\[Version]\en_US\Scripts\Scripts Panel
macOS: ~/Library/Preferences/Adobe InDesign/[Version]/en_US/Scripts/Scripts Panel
Copy the JPGTitleSnapper.jsx file into the Scripts Panel folder.
Launch the Script:

Open Adobe InDesign.
Open your document.

Export Path: Specify the directory where you want to save the exported JPEG files.

Exporting:
